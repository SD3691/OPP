Introduction to Object Oriented Programming:
Introduction, Role of programming languages, need to study programming languages, Characteristics of
good programming languages.
Introduction to various programming paradigms: Procedural, object-oriented, logical and functional,
Features of OOP.
Data Types: variables and constants, Class – Data members, Member Functions, and class as abstract
data type, Object Visibility Modes, Constructor & Types of Constructors, Destructor, Binding – static &
dynamic, Inline Function, Static Members, Static Function, Friend Function, Friend Class, Array of
Objects.
Case Study: Demonstrate Student Database application using classes, objects, constructor, destructor,
friend function in C++.


Inheritance using C++:
Derived class & base class Public, Protected and Private Inheritance, Types ofinheritance, Ambiguity in multiple inheritance & multipath inheritance, Constructor & Destructor in
Inheritance, Order of Constructor and Destructor Call.
Case Study: Know about Firefox and Thunderbird as one of the popular softwares developed using C++.

Polymorphism using C++:
Introduction: Function overloading & Operator overloading: Overloading unary & binary operators, Data
conversion, Pointers to Objects, this pointer, Up-casting, down-casting, Virtual function, Pure virtual
function, Abstract class.
Case Study: Demonstrate Polymorphism for Online Railway Reservation System using C++.

Generic Programming & Exception Handling using C++:
Generic Programming - Function Template Class templates Template with multiple parameters
Exception Handling - Exception Handling: Fundamentals multiple catching nested try statements
uncaught exceptions throw and rethrow Stack unwinding.
Case Study : Study about use of exception handling in Symbian Operating system that was developed
using C++


File Handling:
Classes for file stream operation, Opening and closing a file - File mode, Error Handling functions in
file, File Pointers and Their Manipulation, File Operations on Characters, File Operations on Binary
Files – Variables, Class Objects, Sequential File Organization, Direct Access Files, Indexed sequential
File organization, Linked Organization.
Case Study: Demonstrate an application to maintain employee database using file handling


Standard Template Library:
Standard Template Library (STL), components of STL: Containers, algorithms and iterators,
Containers- Sequence container, associative containers, container adapters, Iterators- input, output,
forward, bidirectional and random access, Algorithms- basic searching and sorting algorithms, min-max
algorithm, set operations
Case Study: Demonstrate an application for managing Person Record (Name, birth date, telephone no).
Perform operations – add, display, search, delete, and update using STL map.
